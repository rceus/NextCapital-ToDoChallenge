### Lighthouse Labs Week 2 Day 2 Assignment - A Todo List

##### Instead of using jQuery, this is to try out another Javascript Framework, AngularJS.

This is my first app built with AngularJS, it has all the functionalities that was implemented in the previous project using jQuery.
Essentially, it is an app that will display a todo list with some fake todo items.
User can easily add in new todos and delete existing ones. There is also a checkbox to mark the items as completed.
Another feature is the ability for user to edit existing todos by clicking on the edit icon.
